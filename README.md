# Hive Commons License

The Hive Commons License is a proposed alternative to copyleft and permissive open source licensing intended to be both enforceably self-sustainable while maintaining compatibility with proprietary codebases.

Software that is licensed under the Hive Commons License can be used and distributed with so long as the user complies with one of two following options. **(1)** The user agrees to open source and license any derivative work under the Hive Commons License. Or **(2)** the user agrees to make a self-assessment of the value of the proprietary derivative work and pay a proportion of that balance into a non-profit foundation with a charter to grow the commons for the benefit of the public. If anyone offers to pay the user an amount equal to their self-assessed valuation the user agrees to immediately open source the derivative works under this license in exchange for the payment.

The first provision would create a viral quality to the license similar to existing copyleft licenses, while the second provision provides an alternative means of compliance that allows for use of the software for proprietary commercial applications while ensuring that such uses fairly and consistently grow the commons.
