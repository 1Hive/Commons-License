# Hive Commons License

The Hive Commons License (HCL) is a proposed alternative to copyleft and permissive open source licensing intended to be self-sustainable while remaining attractive to commercial investment. This balance is maintained by enforcing a self-assessed "tax" on deriviative works that are kept proprietary. 

**Status**: ðŸ”¬ Research

## Core Provisions
- Software under this license can be used freely so long as any derivative works are provided open source and under the same license.
- Software under this license can be used while keeping derivative works proprietary, but such derivative works are subjected to a self-assessed tax so long as they remain proprietary.
- If a proprietary derivative workâ€™s owner is paid their self-assessed valuation they must immediately open source the propriertary derivative work.

## Contributions Wanted

The conceptual and practical feasibility of the Hive Commons License is still being assessed. Any and all contributions are welcome and highly encouraged. Please don't hesistate to [open issues](https://github.com/1Hive/HCL/issues), or join our [keybase chat](https://1hive.org/docs/contribute/keybase.html). 

If you're an attorney with experience **drafting software licenses** or working with **non-profit software foundations** your efforts would be especially helpful at this stage!
